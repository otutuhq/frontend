Financial systems should not be black boxes. Every calculation, balance, and report should be explainable and traceable. Your financial data belongs to you—always. We design Otutu so businesses maintain control over their records, histories, and reports without unnecessary restrictions or lock-ins. Financial data is deeply sensitive. We treat privacy as a core requirement, not an afterthought. Our architecture and workflows are designed to protect user data and limit unnecessary exposure."
